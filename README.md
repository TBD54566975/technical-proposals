# Technical Proposals

## Introduction

This repository contains documents outlining the protocols, procedures, and technologies used in the design of TBD open source components.

These documents typically outline the technical details of a software project, including its design, functionality, and implementation plan. They are often used to communicate ideas and plans to stakeholders, team members, and other parties involved in the project.

## TP Status

Technical proposals each have a status which can be one of the following, inspired by
the [BIP process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki):

- **Idea** – An idea that is not quite a draft and exists as a GitHub issue. Needs feedback and discussion.
- **Draft** – A formal proposal for a feature addition, submitted as a Pull Request against a new *TP directory*.
  Requires feedback, discussion, and approval from a quorum of maintainers before acceptance.
- **Rejected** – A terminal state for a proposal. Possible reasons include deciding to go in a different direction,
  not a good fit, or the proposal being withdrawn or cancelled by the submitter.
- **Accepted** – A terminal state for a proposal. Proposals that are accepted may begin to be developed against.
